\chapter{Prospects}
\label{sec:prospects}

Obviously, in this script, we were not able to show you the least of what \LaTeX{} has to offer. 
Therefore, in this last section, we gathered some information to help you to go further into depth by yourself.

\section{Packages}

We already have presented a selection of packages. However, there are thousands more of them. In the following sections we have put together some packages for frequently needed features:

\begin{description}
	\item[Indices]
		can be created automatically with \pkg{makeidx}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/makeidx}}
		By using \code{latex}{\textbackslash index\{â€¦\}}, one can mark entries for the index. With \code{latex}{\textbackslash printindex}, an index with references is compiled out of them.
	\item[Vector graphics]
		(\cref{fig:tikz-example})
				can be \enquote{drawn} directly in the \LaTeX{} source code with \pkg{TikZ} (recursive acronym for \emph{TikZ ist kein Zeichenprogramm}, in English: \emph{TikZ is not a drawing program}).\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf}}
		Caution: This package is very powerful, but not necessarily beginner-friendly.
		Before creating vector graphics from scratch, we recommend you to experiment with some of the examples at \TeX{}ample\footnote{\url{https://texample.net/tikz/examples/}}. 
		Also, for certain use cases, there are special packages that are easier to handle than \enquote{raw} TikZ:
	\item[Parse trees]
		that divide sentences into their grammatical components (\cref{fig:qtree-example}) can be created with \pkg{qtree}.\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/qtree}}
	\item[Proof trees,]
		that are often used in logics (\cref{fig:prftree-example}), can be drawn with the package \pkg{prftree}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/prftree}}
	\item[Chemical structural formulas]
		(\cref{fig:chemfig-example})
		can, amongst others, be created with  \pkg{chemfig}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/chemfig}}
	\item[Colors]
		for your documents are provided by \pkg{xcolor}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xcolor}}
	\item[Notes]
		that you cannot overlook can be created with \pkg{todonotes}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/todonotes}}
		With this package, you can mark what you still \todo{Please do not change. This is an example.} have to change within your document.
	\item[Pages of other \acro{PDF} files]
		can be integrated into the source code with \texttt{pdfpages}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages}}
		It comes in very handy whenever one needs the output of external programs in the document, for example, in the appendix.
		Just compile the document one more time and the appendix is up to date again, if the external program has changed something.
	\item[Nested graphics]
		and the positioning of captions at almost any place are provided by  
		\pkg{subcaption}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/subcaption}}
		We also made extensive use of this package.
	\item[Tables]
		can be designed much more flexibly than what we have shown here. 
		The following packages can help you with that:
		\pkg{colortbl},\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/colortbl}}
		\pkg{tabularx},\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tabularx}}
		\pkg{multirow},\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/multirow}}
		\pkg{makecell}.\footnote{\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/makecell}}
\end{description}

\noindent \mono{beamer}, which is not a package, but another document class, can be used to create \textbf{slide shows}
with \LaTeX{}. Information on the document class and examples are available at Overleaf,\footnote{\url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer}} which brings us to the next section:

\section{Help and information}

\textbf{Wikibooks} provides you with a much more detailed introduction into \LaTeX{}. Note that the German version\footnote{\url{https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX-Kompendium}} is less complete than the English one.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}}
If required, both refer to additional packages.

Whenever you need information on certain packages, \acro{\textbf{CTAN}}\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/}} is your place to go. 
For each package, you can find the official documentation as a \acro{PDF} file there.
Within this file, the first paragraphs are usually the most interesting. They are 
followed by implementation details, that you normally do not need.

If the official documentation is too theoretical, and you prefer a more hands-on approach, \textbf{Overleaf}\footnote{\url{https://www.overleaf.com/}} can help you out.
Primarily, it is a collaborative online \LaTeX{} editor. However, you can find multiple templates\footnote{\url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates}} for different types of documents (VCs, theses, \textellipsis) there.

If you are looking for examples dedicated to TikZ, \textbf{\TeX{}ample}\footnote{\url{https://texample.net/}} provides you with multiple of them.

For concrete questions, the question-answering platform \textbf{Stackexchange} is a good place to go: There even is a \TeX{} community there.\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/}}

Of course, you can always contact us with your questions:
