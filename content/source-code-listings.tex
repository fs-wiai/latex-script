\chapter{Source code listings}
\label{sec:source-code-listings}

There are many ways in \LaTeX{} to display source code.
We have come to appreciate the package \pkg{minted}, which causes some additional installation overhead, but generates very appealing source code renderings.
However, especially on macOS, the installation of minted has caused a lot of headache in the early days of this workshop.
That's why we will also have a look at an alternative called \pkg{lstlistings}.
