\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use Google Scholar to retrieve Bib\TeX{} entries for the following \LaTeX{}
  handbooks:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Leslie Lamport (1994): \LaTeX. A Document Preparation System.
    \item Dilip Datta (2017): \LaTeX\ in 24 Hours. A Practical Guide for Scientific Writing.
    \item Frank Mittelbach / Michel Goossens (2002): Der \LaTeX-Begleiter.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Compare the entries with the results that \url{dblp.org} finds for the same titles.
  \item Create a new Bib\TeX{} file called \file{literature.bib} in the 
  \file{exercises/literature} folder.
  \item Add the Bib\TeX{} entries to the newly created Bib\TeX{} files. For this, select your preferred source among Google Scholar and dblp.
  \item Assign unique and meaningful Bib\TeX{} keys.
  \item Include the Bib\TeX{} file in a suitable location, where later on the references should be listed.
  \item Cite the three handbooks in the 
  file\\\file{exercises/literature/literature.tex}.
  \item Make use of the \mono{natdin} biliography style.
  \item \textbf{Note}: If compiling fails, it may help to remove all auxiliary 
  files \\(\mono{main.aux/bbl/blg/loc/out/pdf/soc/toc}) before compiling again.
