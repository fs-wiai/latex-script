% breakanywhere doesn't seem to work.
For this task, we are using the file \mintinline[breakanywhere]{bash}{exercises/special-characters/special-}\newline\mintinline[breakanywhere]{bash}{characters.tex}.
To be able to see your results here within the script,
compile the \mintinline{bash}{main.tex} file.
This applies for the subsequent tasks, as well.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the text, you find a bunch of abbreviations. Replace the spaces within the abbreviations by thin spaces. Put a thin space in front of the word \emph{EUR}.
	\item Replace the hyphens within the Erba opening hours by en dashes.
	\item Restrict the hyphenation of word \emph{Studierendenausweis} to one position: \\\emph{Studierenden-ausweis}.
	\item Add quotation marks around the words \emph{Studi-Ticket} and \emph{Studi-Karte} using the \mintinline{latex}{\enquote} command.
	\item Replace the word \emph{EUR} by a Euro symbol (hence the thin space). 
\end{enumerate}
