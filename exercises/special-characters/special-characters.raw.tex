What is a semester ticket?
It is also known as Studi-Ticket or Studi-Karte and allows you to use the local public transport around Bamberg for free.
In Bamberg, your student card (Studierendenausweis) is used, i. a., as a semester ticket.
To be able to use it, you should validate the student card in one of the university buildings.
This is possible after you have paid the semester fees.
Validation printers are located in multiple university buildings, e. g., in the foyer of the Erba building, in front of the library.
This building is opened Monday - Friday, 7am - 10pm.
