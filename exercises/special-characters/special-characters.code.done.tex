What is a semester ticket?
It is also known as \enquote{Studi-Ticket} or \enquote{Studi-Karte} in German and allows you to use the local public transport around Bamberg for free.
In Bamberg, the semester ticked is embodied in your student card (Studierendenausweis).
To be able to use it, you have to validate the student card in one of the university buildings.
This is possible after you have paid the semester fees.
Validation printers are located in multiple university buildings, e.\,g., in the foyer of the Erba building, in front of the library.
This building is opened Monday\,--\,Friday, 7am\,--\,10pm.
