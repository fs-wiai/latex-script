You will find a file called \file{Source.java} in the folder 
\file{exercises/source-code-listings}.
We will now include it into our document and adjust its display to fit our needs.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Include the file into 
  \file{exercises/source-code-listings/source-code-listings.tex}.
  \item Activate syntax highlighting by stating the programming language Java.
  \item Add line breaks and line numbers.
  \item Use the theme \code{latex}{native}.
  \item This theme is optimized for a dark background. Change the background color to dark blue.
  \item Include only lines 5 to 7.
  \item Delete the spaces at the beginning of the lines by using a suitable 
  option. (Hint: The documentation speaks of \code{latex}{gobble}.)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent If you have questions, consult the minted package documentation.
