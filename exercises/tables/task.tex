The following list shows some key data about a few courses of the \acro{WIAI} faculty.
However, the overview is not as clear as it could be.
To improve it, convert the list into a table with columns for \emph{name}, \emph{abbreviation} and \emph{term}.
Insert an additional \emph{centered column} that numbers the courses. 
Add a caption to the table.
You find the table in \mintinline{bash}{exercises/tables/tables.tex}.

\exercisematerial{exercises/tables/tables}
