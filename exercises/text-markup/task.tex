\section{Emphasising text}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In \file{exercies/text-markup/markup.tex}, emphasize the words 
  ``recursion'' and ``recursive.''
  \item Make the \textsc{url} clickable. 
  \item Of course, you can also experiment with the other commands that you learned for text markup. However, you might want to remove them afterwards to keep your document nice and tidy.
\end{enumerate}
