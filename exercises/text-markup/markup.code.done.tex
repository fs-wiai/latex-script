``\emph{Recursion} (adjective: \emph{recursive}) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.
\emph{Recursion} is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic.
The most common application of \emph{recursion} is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition.''
