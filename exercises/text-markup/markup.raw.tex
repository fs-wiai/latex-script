``Recursion (adjective: recursive) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.
Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic.
The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science,
where a function being defined is applied within its own definition.''
