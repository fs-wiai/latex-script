\begin{enumerate}
  \item Put the sections of the file into separate files, named \file{section1.tex} and \file{section2.tex}. 
  Include them using the \code{latex}{\textbackslash input} command. (In TeXstudio, make sure that you select the main file as the file to be compiled by right-clicking on it and selecting \enquote{Select as explicit root document.})
  \item Can the preamble also live in its own file? Find out by moving it analogously to the sections. If no, why? If yes, why can outsourcing the preamble be useful?
\end{enumerate}
