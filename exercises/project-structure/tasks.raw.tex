  \item \textbf{Put the sections of the file into separate files, named} 
  \file{section1.tex}, \file{section2.tex}\textbf{, and} \file{section3.tex}. 
  \textbf{Include them using the} \code{latex}{\textbackslash input} \textbf{command. (In TeXstudio, make sure that you select the main file as the file to be compiled by right-clicking on it and selecting \enquote{Select as explicit root document.})}
