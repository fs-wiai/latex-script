\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
       \textbf{Put the sections of the file into separate files, named 
    	\file{section1.tex}, \file{section2.tex}, and 
    	\file{section3.tex}. 
    	Include them using the  \code{latex}{\textbackslash include} command.}

    \item \textbf{Which command becomes superfluous when you use 
  	\code{latex}{\textbackslash include}?} \\
  	\code{latex}{\textbackslash include} makes every included file appear on a 
  	new 
  	page. Hence the command \code{latex}{\textbackslash newpage} becomes 
  	superfluous.
  \item 
    \textbf{Can the preamble also be excluded? If no, why? If yes, when can 
    	outsourcing the preamble be useful?} \\
    The preamble can also be outsourced, like in task 1. In real-world \LaTeX{} 
    projects we often make use of numerous packages that need to be configured 
    by additional commands within the preamble. Therefore, it is advisable to 
    outsource the preamble. On top of that, this is useful because the file 
    with the most-commonly used packages can be moved from one project to 
    another without needing to rewrite the preamble every time.
  \item 
    \textbf{Add the command \code{latex}{\textbackslash 
    includeonly\{section2\}} to the 
    preamble. Compile the document again, and check what has changed. What does 
    the command do and how can it be helpful in a larger project? } \\
	The command \code{latex}{\textbackslash includeonly\{section2\}} does 
	exactly what 
	the name already says. During compilation, only the 
	\code{latex}{\textbackslash include} 
	statements that contain file names that appear in 
	\code{latex}{\textbackslash includeonly\{file1,file2, â€¦\}} are included.
	
	This can be useful for larger projects, when the compile time becomes 
	longer since by using the \code{latex}{\textbackslash includeonly} only the 
	files 
	can be included which we are currently working in. Before the final 
	compilation we can delete the \code{latex}{\textbackslash includeonly} 
	command and 
	end up with our complete \acro{PDF}.
