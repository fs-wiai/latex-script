\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
       \textbf{Put the sections of the file into separate files, named 
    	\texttt{section1.tex}, \texttt{section2.tex}, and 
    	\texttt{section3.tex}. 
    	Include them using the  \mintinline{latex}{\include} command.}

    \item \textbf{Which command becomes superfluous when you use 
  	\mintinline{latex}{\include}?} \\
  	\mintinline{latex}{\include} makes every included file appear on a new 
  	page. Hence the command \mintinline{latex}{\newpage} becomes superfluous.
  \item 
    \textbf{Can the preamble also be excluded? If no, why? If yes, why can 
    	outsourcing the preamble be useful?} \\
    The preamble can also be outsourced, like in task 1. In real-world \LaTeX{} 
    projects we often make use of numerous packages that need to be configured 
    by additional commands within the preamble. Therefore, it is advisable to 
    outsource the preamble. On top of that, this is useful because the file can 
    with the most-commonly used packages can be moved from one project to 
    another without needing to rewrite the preamble every time.
  \item 
    \textbf{Add the command \mintinline{latex}{\includeonly{section2}} to the 
    preamble. Compile the document again, and check what has changed. What does 
    the command do and why can it be helpful in a larger project? } \\
	The command \mintinline{latex}{\includeonly{section2}} doex exactly what 
	the name already says. During compilation, only the 
	\mintinline{latex}{\include} 
	statements that contain file names that appear in 
	\mintinline{latex}{includeonly{file1,file2, â€¦}} are included.
	
	This can be useful for larger projects, when the compile time becomes 
	longer since by using the \mintinline{latex}{\includeonly} only the files 
	can be included which we are currently working in. Before the final 
	compilation we can delete the \mintinline{latex}{\includeonly} command and 
	end up with our complete \acro{PDF}.
