Java is an object-oriented programming language that appeared in 1995. The most recent long-term support version of the programming language is Java SE 21 (released in September 2023). In order to write Java programs, one needs to install the so-called \emph{Java Development Kit (JDK)}. Java programs can be written independently from the operating system that one uses.
