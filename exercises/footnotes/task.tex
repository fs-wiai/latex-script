\section{Footnotes and references}

\subsection{Inserting footnotes}

Make the text \enquote{March 2021} of the file 
\file{exercises/footnotes/footnotes.tex} appear as a footnote instead of in 
parentheses. Additionally, insert a clickable URL to the Java Development Kit 
as footnote.

\texttt{https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html}

\subsection{Inserting references}

In file \file{exercises/references/references.tex}, replace \enquote{in the 
figure} and \enquote{the following source code listing} with suited references. 
Use the command \code{latex}{\textbackslash cref}. Do not forget to first 
introduce labels for the elements that you want to reference. To do so, first 
of all, wrap the source code listing in a \code{latex}{listing} environment.
Also, insert a caption for the source code listing. 
Make sure to use suitable prefixes before the labels.
