In file \texttt{exercises/references/references.tex}, replace \enquote{in the figure} and \enquote{the following source code listing} with suited references. Use the command \mintinline{latex}{\cref}. Do not forget to first introduce labels for the elements that you want to reference. To do so, first of all, wrap the source code listing in a \mintinline{latex}{listing} environment. Also insert a caption for the source code listing. 
Make sure to use suitable prefixes before the labels.
