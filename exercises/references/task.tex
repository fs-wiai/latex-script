\subsection{Inserting references}

In file \file{exercises/references/references.tex}, replace \enquote{in the 
figure} and \enquote{the following source code listing} with suited references. 
Use the command \code{latex}{\textbackslash cref}. Do not forget to first 
introduce labels for the elements that you want to reference. 
Make sure to use suitable prefixes before the labels.

For source code listings, adding labels and captions is a bit different.
Try to apply the knowledge you gained so far to retrieve the correct version of the \code{\lstinputlisting} command.
