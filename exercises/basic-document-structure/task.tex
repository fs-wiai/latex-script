\section{Structure your document and text}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the directory \file{exercises/basic-document-structure}, you can find a file named \file{document-structure.tex}. Wrap the text of the file in a \code{latex}{document} environment and add the following preamble. Afterwards, compile the document. 
	\codeblock{latex}{./exercises/basic-document-structure/preamble.code.tex}
	\item Congratulations! You have created and compiled your first \LaTeX{} 
	document. Maybe you have noticed that paragraphs within the text were 
	created by using \code{latex}{\textbackslash\textbackslash}. Replace the 
	two backslashes by real paragraphs.
	\item It is time to structure your first document. Use the \LaTeX{} 
	commands \code{latex}{\textbackslash section}, 
	\code{latex}{\textbackslash subsection}, etc. to structure the text. 
	Also, 
	include 
	a table of contents for your document. 
	\item Afterwards, comment out the preamble, the document environment, and the table of contents. 
\end{enumerate}
