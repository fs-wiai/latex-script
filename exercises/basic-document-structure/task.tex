\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the directory \mintinline{latex}{exercises/basic-document-structure}, you can find a file named \mintinline{latex}{document-structure.tex}. Open the file, copy its text and paste it into a new file. You can name the new file as you want. Wrap the text of your new file in a \mintinline{latex}{document} environment and add a preamble in order to be able to compile your first \LaTeX{} document. 
	\item Congratulations! You have created and compiled your first \LaTeX{} document. Maybe you have noticed that paragraphs within the text were created by using \mintinline{latex}{\\}. Replace the two backslashes by real paragraphs.
	\item It is time to structure your first document. Use the \LaTeX{} commands \mintinline{latex}{\section}, \mintinline{latex}{\subsection}, etc. to structure the text. Also, include a table of contents for your document. 
	\item Afterwards, comment out the preamble, the document environment, and the table of contents.
