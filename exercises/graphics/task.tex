\section{Inserting graphics}

In the \file{exercises/graphics} directory you can find an image file 
\file{latex-logo.png}. Insert the image into the 
\file{exercises/graphics/graphics.tex} file. Make sure that the image is placed 
exactly where you have specified it. On top of that, the picture shall be 
centered, and a caption shall be added. Adapt the image width to the text width 
(\code{latex}{\textbackslash textwidth}).
