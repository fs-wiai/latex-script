# LaTeX Script by Fachschaft WIAI

This script introduces the most fundamental LaTeX mechanisms to get students started. It is used both as a reference and as exercise material for our [LaTeX workshop](https://wiai.de/latex-weekend), a **two-day tutorial aimed at students from various backgrounds**. At the moment, it is only available in German. The following topics are covered:

* general introduction to the LaTeX system 
* basic document structure
* structuring a more complex project
* special characters
* text markup
* formatting paragraphs
* lists
* maths and formulas
* sourcecode listings
* graphics
* tables
* footnotes
* references
* literature management

Most chapters contain exercises to be performed within the script itself, practically teaching the aspects that are introduced by the text.

## Requirements

Compiling the script requires a working LaTeX installation.
For sourcecode listings, we are using Pygments and Python3.
The Makefile comes in handy for compiling the different versions of the script (see usage section).
